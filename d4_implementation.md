# D4 Implementation 1

## Introduction 
The value proposition of our software is to help users build healthier spending habits that prevent Regret, Impulse,Under-planning
and Unsustainable purchases. And our software will be a mobile phone application which built by Android Studio. Each user can have a account that record the goods they have bought or want to bought in the future.

## Adopted Technologies


## Learning / Training 
In order to put out this basic application we had to read some articles to learn how to use Android Studio. We also had to learn the git commands for posting things to the github. We also watched videos that were posted in the discord on how to use and code in Android Studio.

## Deployment

## Look and Feel


## Lessons Learned
The lesson we learned is that we should not wait until the last minute to start our coding on our project. For our next release we will make sure to start earlier on our application and work together better.
