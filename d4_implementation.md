# D4 Implementation 1

## Introduction 
The value proposition of our software is to help users build healthier spending habits that prevent Regret, Impulse,Under-planning
and Unsustainable purchases. And our software will be a mobile phone application which built by Android Studio. Each user can have a account that record the goods they have bought or want to bought in the future.

## Implementation Requirements 
The only  two real requirement that have been implemented are the user stories "As a user I want to add past purchaes so I can track them" and "As a user I want to see a list of the purchases that I have been making. Bailey was the only one to work on any of it so far.

## Adopted Technologies
The major adopeted technologies that we used are Android Studio and its built in virtual phone machine. Android Studio was selected because it seemed to be the most accessable of the app-making IDE's, as well as having a lot of easy to follow tutorials and many resources that ould make it easiest to use. The Virtual phone that I have been using is the Google Pixel 3 running Android 10,it seems to be the most reasonably up-to-date type of enviroment for our app.


## Learning / Training 
In order to put out this basic application we had to read some articles to learn how to use Android Studio. We also had to learn the git commands for posting things to the github. We also watched videos that were posted in the discord on how to use and code in Android Studio.

## Deployment
We plan for continual deployment once we get our application farther along. We would have update constantly and consistently pushing out updates and patches for the best experience for our users.

## Look and Feel
The look and feel we are trying to go with is simple and easy-to-use. We want the app to be easy to navigate and figure out. The tabs are very clearly labeled and they all do and include exactly what they say. 


## Lessons Learned
The lesson I learned is that no one else has been coding and it is getting difficult to try to get in contact with out group to make sure they are working.
