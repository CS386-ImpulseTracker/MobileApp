  1. ### Problem Position Statement
     Directed at young adults who need to keep track of spending, the Impluse Tracker mobile app provides an easy and intuitive way to track your impluse spending habits, helping you make the right choice with every purchase. 
    

  1. ### Value Proposition

   Application Developers ——  Bailey Erickson, Chenhao Li, Robin Applegate,Oshan Wijesooriya 
  * Develop different parts of the product and Gather information and acquire necessary knowledge，developers should also test the software.
  
   Testers/Users —— NAU students 
  * The users will test and use the application and make feedback so that we can improve the application and make it better able to meet user needs.
  
   Competitors —— Drnkpay, Urge, finder.com's Icebox 
  * These competitors have the same aim like our product—— help people avoid impulse shopping, however the Drnkpay can only help people who are drunk, and finder.com's Icebox is a plugin which can only apply for online shopping.

## 5. MVP ( *Minimum Viable Product* )
  We as a group are going to makesure that we keep the app very simple and then build up from there. We will do a lot of testing and only make sure that we are pushing code that is functional to the GitHub Repository. We want to also make sure we keep track of who is doing what so we can have an easier way to track issues back to the creator. For our requirements we will make sure that we start with the requirements that matter most to us to integrate into the application and then if we have the time and resources we will work on the ore complex features in our application.
