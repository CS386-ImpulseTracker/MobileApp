# D6 Implementation 2

## Introduction 
The value proposition of our software is to help users build healthier spending habits that prevent Regret, impulse, under-planning
and unsustainable purchases. And our software will be a mobile phone application which built by Android Studio. Each user can have a account that record the goods they have purchased or want to purchase in the future. This app will allow for the user(s) to enter, update, and delete purchases that they have made, these purchases will help construct a graph of te users purchase history to help with healthier spending habits and promote more financial stability.

## Code Quality
In this iteration of our release we used mostly Java and we all generally followed Java's coding best practices that we have learned from previous NAU courses.
To foster a higher quality code, we need to use the software principles we learned in the class like SOLID principles, and we can also use some code quality knowledge. As we all know that it is harder to read code than write code. After writing the code, I think we can read the code so that we can find the bugs in the code.



## Lessons Learned
In Retrospective I think that we as a team are still struggling to work together and really get our application running. We are also still struggling with people that do not necessarily do all of the work they are given consistently. We think that if we were to keep working on this project together we would really have to be stricter about deadlines and not allowing anyone to slack off like we have been.

In this project, I came to the conclusion that every member of the team should have a sense of time, and everyone should attend the meeting on time, so as to make the whole team run well.
Otherwise we could not finish the task on time, but we have gradually solved the problem since the last meeting.
