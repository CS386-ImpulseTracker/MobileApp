# D7 Verification and Validation

## Introduction 
The value proposition of our software is to help users build healthier spending habits that prevent Regret, impulse, under-planning
and unsustainable purchases. And our software will be a mobile phone application which built by Android Studio. Each user can have a account that record the goods they have purchased or want to purchase in the future. This app will allow for the user(s) to enter, update, and delete purchases that they have made, these purchases will help construct a graph of te users purchase history to help with healthier spending habits and promote more financial stability.

## Verification(tests)
### Unit Tests
A unit test is an automated test that aims to verify the behavior of a component isolated from the rest of the system. For this deliverable, you should have automated tests for the main components of your project. Provide the following information:
#### Test Framework Used: 

#### Link to GitHub folder with automated unit tests:

#### Test Case Using Mock Objects and Link: 

#### A Print Screen: 


### Integration Tests
An integration test is an automated test that verifies the implementation of a business rule that involves multiple components with the goal of certifying that they work together to produce the expected result. They are often performed in the same test platform as the unit tests. Provide the following information:
#### Testing Framework Used:

#### Link to GitHub folder with automated integration tests:

#### Integration Test Example and Link:

#### A print screen: 

### Acceptance Tests
An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:

## Validation

### Script:
The script should have the tasks that you will give to the user, what you are going to collect, and what you are going to ask. Do not forget to add questions about the users’ general impressions. You can ask open questions (e.g., How would you describe the homepage of our app? How do you compare our system to the competitor X?) or closed questions (On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the layout of our application? On the same scale, how likely would you use the system in its current state?). Take a look at the inception and requirements deliverables to help create the script (aim to check if you are achieving your initial goals and if the features are implemented in a satisfactory way).

### Results:
Conduct the user evaluation with at least 3 users. Report the data that you collected.

### Reflections:
Reflect on what you observed. Some questions that you can explore: What features worked well? What can be changed? How is the learning curve of your system? Did the users preform the tasks as you expected? Did the users’ actions produce the  results they expected? What did the users like the most? Is your value proposition accomplished?
