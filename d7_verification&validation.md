# D7 Verification and Validation

## Introduction 
The value proposition of our software is to help users build healthier spending habits that prevent Regret, impulse, under-planning
and unsustainable purchases. And our software will be a mobile phone application which built by Android Studio. Each user can have a account that record the goods they have purchased or want to purchase in the future. This app will allow for the user(s) to enter, update, and delete purchases that they have made, these purchases will help construct a graph of te users purchase history to help with healthier spending habits and promote more financial stability.

## Verification(tests)
### Unit Tests
A unit test is an automated test that aims to verify the behavior of a component isolated from the rest of the system. For this deliverable, you should have automated tests for the main components of your project. Provide the following information:
#### Test Framework Used: 

#### Link to GitHub folder with automated unit tests:

#### Test Case Using Mock Objects and Link: 

#### A Print Screen: 


### Integration Tests
An integration test is an automated test that verifies the implementation of a business rule that involves multiple components with the goal of certifying that they work together to produce the expected result. They are often performed in the same test platform as the unit tests. Provide the following information:
#### Testing Framework Used:

#### Link to GitHub folder with automated integration tests:

#### Integration Test Example and Link:

#### A print screen: 

### Acceptance Tests
An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:

##### Interview Questions:
What do you think about our app even though it is unfinished?

Do you think you would use it if it was a finished project?

What do you think about the user interface?

Do you think that this would help you track unhealthy spending habits if it was complete?

Would seeing your unhealthy habits tracked out on a graph help you limit your impulse spending?

What would you like to see this app become?

### Reflections:
I think overall I got pretty positive feedback on what the app is as its unfinished shell of what it could be. The majority of the people I talked to had decent things to say and would likely use it. The 'add item' feature worked well as did the 'delete last'. We should add the ability to select items and edit them as well as select and delete them. The people that I talked to carried out the short list of tasks that I made out. I do believe that the users got the desired results from their actions because there really isn't a lot that can go wrong in this app. The users that I talked with seemed to like the easy to use interface with simple toggles between pages and simple fields and actions. I personally think that if the app was finished that it would accomplish our value propostion, but I think that right now as it stand only half finished it would not accomplish the value proposition.
